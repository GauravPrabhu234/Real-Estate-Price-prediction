# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction using Linear Regression

#  📋 Overview
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using a linear regression model. It involves analyzing historical housing data, extracting relevant features, and applying machine learning techniques to estimate property prices. The goal is to build a reliable model that helps in making accurate predictions based on property attributes.
